## [Unreleased]

### Open source prep (2026-05-12)

#### Added

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — engine-internal deep dive covering the five
  moat crates, request flow, and the design choices behind PAX
  segments, trace-locality compaction, late materialization,
  Tantivy-inline FTS, and object-store WAL.
- `examples/python_quickstart.py` and `examples/typescript_quickstart.ts`
  — minimal ingest + query against `/v1/ingest` + `/v1/query`.
- README callout for the Next.js console under `web/`.
- Guardrail comment in `.github/CODEOWNERS` flagging that the
  referenced GitHub teams must exist or be swapped for individual
  handles.

#### Changed

- `homepage` (Cargo.toml + README) now points at `zenith.polarity.so`.

#### Removed

- **`SqliteCatalog`** and the entire `migrations/sqlite/` directory.
  SQLite was the original dev backend; it does not survive cluster
  scale-up (single-writer, no replication, no failover) and was the
  source of confusion about what to deploy in production.

#### Added

- **`PostgresCatalog`** (`crates/zen_catalog/src/postgres.rs`) is now
  the production backend. Migrations live in `migrations/postgres/`
  with Postgres-native types (BYTEA, BIGINT, TIMESTAMPTZ).
  `next_commit_id` uses `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE … RETURNING`
  to serialize concurrent writers through one row lock.
- **`MockCatalog`** (`crates/zen_catalog/src/mock.rs`) — in-memory,
  no SQL, for tests + benches. Same `Catalog` trait, same semantics
  (monotonic commit-id allocation, tenant-scoped supersede, lease
  TTL). Replaces `SqliteCatalog::open_in_memory()` everywhere.

#### Changed

- `CatalogConfig`: `backend` defaults to `"mock"`; `sqlite_path` field
  removed; `postgres_url` required when `backend = "postgres"`.
- `Cargo.toml`: workspace `sqlx` switched to `postgres + tls-rustls-aws-lc-rs`
  features; `sqlite` feature dropped from `zen_catalog`.
- `examples/zenithdb.dev.toml`: defaults to `backend = "mock"`; the
  Postgres URL is shown as a commented-out hint with `CHANGEME` literal.
- README, RUNBOOK, SCALING docs scrubbed of "sqlite single-node"
  language. Production posture is "Postgres always".

#### Migration

If you were running on SQLite locally, switch to either:

1. **Mock backend** for ephemeral dev: `backend = "mock"` (no setup,
   data lost on restart).
2. **Real Postgres** via the dev compose stack: `docker compose -f
   deploy/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d` and set
   `backend = "postgres"` + `postgres_url`.

There is **no automatic migration** from a SQLite catalog file to
Postgres — operators with persistent SQLite data should export it
manually before upgrading.

### Production-readiness sprint (2026-05-07)

#### Added

- **Auth (`zen_auth` crate)**: JWT (RS256 + JWKS) for customer traffic;
  HMAC-SHA256 for inter-node `/v1/internal/*`. Verified `Claims` injected
  into request extensions; per-token claims cache (16 K entries, 5 min TTL).
- **TLS termination**: `axum-server` + `rustls` + `aws-lc-rs` for AES-NI.
  Optional — falls back to plaintext when `server.tls.cert_path` is empty.
- **Observability**: `/v1/metrics` Prometheus endpoint with histograms
  (`zen_query_duration_seconds`, `zen_ingest_duration_seconds`, etc.) and
  counters (`zen_queries_total`, `zen_ingest_rows_total`). OTLP tracing
  exporter wired from `telemetry.otlp_endpoint` config.
- **Rate limiting**: per-tenant token bucket (default 100 QPS / 1000 burst);
  global concurrency cap (default 256).
- **Health probes**: `/v1/healthz` (liveness — process up) split from
  `/v1/readyz` (readiness — catalog reachable).
- **Graceful shutdown**: SIGTERM / SIGINT trigger memtable flush to WAL
  before exit.
- **Encryption (`zen_crypto` crate)**: AES-256-GCM envelope encryption
  with pluggable root key (static / KMS).
- **Backup / restore**: `zen admin-backup` and `zen admin-restore` CLIs
  serialize a tenant's segments + manifest to a directory and replay them
  against a fresh catalog.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for `fmt`, `clippy --D warnings`, `test`,
  `audit`, `deny`. Release pipeline builds + signs multi-arch Docker
  images on tag.
- **Helm hardening**: PodDisruptionBudget, HPA, NetworkPolicy,
  ServiceAccount with IRSA hooks, Ingress template.
- **Terraform hardening**: KMS key, SSE-KMS bucket, Secrets Manager for
  catalog DB credentials, multi-AZ RDS with deletion protection, IAM
  least-privilege policy.

#### Changed

- **WAL durability is ON by default** (was off via `ZEN_FS_DURABLE=1`).
  Opt out with `ZEN_UNSAFE_FAST=1` or `LocalFsStore::new_unsafe_fast` —
  reproducible-data scenarios only. Measured cost: +21% p95 on
  write_flush 100×100 KB (17.5 ms → 21.2 ms), still 5–15× faster than
  Postgres / DuckDB at the same workload.
- **`put` now actually fsyncs** when `durable=true` (previous bug: only
  `put_if_absent` honored the flag, so segments written by the compactor
  were never durabilized).
- Auth-off mode now logs a loud warning at boot.

#### Fixed

- 83 → 0 clippy warnings; CI now enforces `-D warnings`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-04

Initial build:

- 18-crate Rust workspace (~13 K LOC).
- PAX columnar segments with FSST + ZSTD + Gorilla XOR + FoR + RLE + dict.
- Tantivy-as-library FTS, embedded inline in segments.
- HNSW vectors, JSON-path indexing, roaring bitmap posting lists.
- Tokio-only async runtime.
- HTTP / gRPC / OTLP endpoints.
- ZenithQL + SQL frontends.
- 3-node clustering via rendezvous-hash sharding (`zen_cluster`).
